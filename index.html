  Happy Valentine’s Day my aduuu paduuuuuu 💖💘  

  This is one of my favourite days of the year, because it represents <em>us</em>  just like any other day…  
  but a little more special ✨  

  This is our <strong>first Valentine’s Day as a couple</strong>, and I wanted to make it as special as possible for you 💞  
  Even though we aren’t able to spend it together physically, with you, distance is honestly just a formality 🌍❤️  

  You’re with me throughout the day in so many little ways 
  and every single one of them makes me fall in love with you more and more 🥺💗  

  So I decided I’d be a part of <em>your</em> Valentine’s Day 
  for <strong>all seven days of Valentine’s</strong> 🌹🍫🧸💋  
  Only open each day when the day arrives 😌💌  

  I love you a lottt babyyyy 🫶💖  
  I hope you don’t feel alone this Valentine’s Day,  
  and that you never feel the need to look at others and be happy for them  
  because we can always look at <em>each other</em>,  
  even if it’s just through a screen for now 📱❤️  

  I love youuuuuuu endlessly 💘✨

  Happy Chocolate Dayyy my loveee 🍫🤎  

  You know… life is just sweeter with you in it —  
  not because you make it perfect,  
  but because you make it lighter 🥺✨  

  Everything feels easier when you’re around.  
  The bad days don’t feel as heavy,  
  and the good days feel even better 💞  

  I still remember the first time I gave you a KitKat 🍫  
  I felt so happy when you took it —  
  something so small, yet it meant so much to me 🥹  

  And every single time after that,  
  whenever I gave you a chocolate and you took it,  
  I felt that same happiness all over again 🤍  

  It was never really about the chocolate…  
  it was about you accepting something from me,  
  about sharing these little moments together 💖  

  Just like chocolates,  
  you’ve added sweetness to my life in ways I can’t even explain 🍬✨  

  Happy Chocolate Day babyyyy 🍫❤️  
  Always yours 💌

  You know I always joke about when we’ll kiss or make out

  but because I don’t want the moment to ever end 🫶  

  Every kiss with you,  
  even the ones that exist only in my head,  
  feels warm, slow, and full of love 🤍

  <strong>Happy Valentine’s Day my love ❤️</strong><br><br>

  This is the first Valentine’s Day we are spending together.  
  And even though we’re in a long-distance relationship, today somehow feels like I’m very close to you 🤍  
  It feels different in ways I can’t fully describe — but I can feel it, deeply — and it feels so, so good.<br><br>

  This day is ours.  
  Not because of flowers, gifts, or posts —  
  but because of <em>us</em>.<br><br>

  Every laugh we’ve shared.  
  Every fight that taught us something.  
  Every late-night conversation where the world disappeared and it was just you and me.  
  Every single moment where we chose each other again and again 🤍<br><br>

  You are my safest place.  
  You are my favourite thought.  
  You are the person I want every tomorrow with — until my last breath.<br><br>

  No matter where we are,  
  no matter how far life takes us,  
  no matter how hard things get —  
  it will <strong>always</strong> be you.<br><br>

  You are my everything.  
  My strength when I feel weak.  
  My calm when my mind is loud.  
  My home, even from miles away.<br><br>

  You are my goddess.  
  My <em>devi</em> ✨  
  Loving you feels like devotion.<br><br>

  You are my today.  
  My tomorrow.  
  My always.<br><br>
